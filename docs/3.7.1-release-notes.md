### Features
- Introduce new column on code table `IsDataPartOriginEntityCode`

  `IsDataPartOriginEntityCode` indicates whether the code is the origin entity code in any dataparts, of the entity.
  No action is required to upgrade to this version, but certain actions can be taken to populate the column with values faster then it otherwise would.
