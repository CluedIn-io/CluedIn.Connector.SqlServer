# 3.7.1 Upgrade notes

## Upgrading from earlier version than `3.7.0`

See upgrade steps in: `UpgradeNotes/3.7.0/3.7.0-upgrade-notes.md`

## Upgrading to `3.7.1`

In 3.7.1, a new column `IsDataPartOriginEntityCode` is introduced on the codes table.
The column will store a bit value (`true`/`false`), indicating whether the
code is the origin entity code in any data parts.

This column will automatically be added the first time the connector is loaded.
Since we didn't have the information before, the column will be filled with `null`.
As entities are processed, the column will be populated.

If you want all of rows to have a value in `IsDataPartOriginEntityCode`, you can either:
- Reprocess the entities that are in your stream (fx. using gql)
- Post to the the admin endpoint:
  `/api/admin/commands/PopulateOriginEntityCodesCollections?organizationId=[id]`
  This will populate the origin entity codes collection on all entities, not just the ones in your stream(s).
