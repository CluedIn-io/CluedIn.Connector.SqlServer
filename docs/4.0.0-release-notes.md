### Features
- React to new setting in platform, ditating whether to stream edge properties or not.

### Chores
- Updated to .NET6
- Disable MARS (multiple active result sets).
  This is to mirror change in platform, and to improve performance.

### Fixes
- Prepend tablename with underscore, if it starts with a digit, since table names cannot start with digits in mssql.
- Cap length column names, and append hash value of name, to ensure uniqueness
